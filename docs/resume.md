## Experience

### January 2018 - Present | Senior Software Engineer/Team Lead | CPA Global

* **January 2021 - Present**: Team lead on a greenfield project. The effort is desinged to standardize and integrate data between numerous system, both current and legacy. The system is a REST API written in Typescript/Node.js, and hosted in Amazon AWS. The primary function of the API is to validate and ensure data integrity between systems by enforcing a common data model. The model uses JSON objects, which define rules for data types. Incoming data is then evaluated against a validation engine which rejects malformed data. If the data is valid, it is saved to DocumentDB hosted in Amazon AWS, where other systems can retrieve the data on demand.

* **June 2020 - December 2020**: Served as team lead/scrum master on a project with a Node.js/Serverless backend and Angular/Typescript frontend hosted in AWS. Helped to bring the project to market by working closely with product and developers to add new features. Additionally, emphasized the importance of automated unit/integration testing, making unit tests first-class citizens. Coverage increased drastically on the frontend, which initially had no working unit tests, and the backend.

* **Jan 2018 - May 2020**: Hired to build a team of near-shore developers from Costa Rica and bring a product to market that was being handed over from developers in Linköping, Sweden. The application was written with Microsoft WebApi and SQL Server on the backend with an Angular frontend and hosted in Microsoft Azure. I served as scrum master and worked closely with product management. Our team was able to launch on time and deliver a quality product that was received well and immediately became mission critical. Responsible for leading ongoing development and support until June 2020.
