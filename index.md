# Intro

I'm Rob, a longtime software engineer. When I'm not at work writing code, I have a wife, a son (who just shipped off to college), and two cats. My home office is adorned with banjos, guitars, and a fiddle, which I play with varying degrees of mediocrity. During the day, I like taking a brisk 20-minute walk to clear my head, get some fresh air, and get some exercise. I have a passion for old-time folk, blues, and country music, and I've recently developed an interest in Cajun music, culture, and language.

Feel free to reach out any time using one of the above links.

It will benefit both of us if you tell me what you're looking for, so I can respond appropriately.

## Fun Facts

I'm an Austin, TX-based software engineer who was doing full-stack development before the term existed (ca. 1999). Get off my lawn, or something. Here are some of my interests and hobbies, as well as some fun facts.


- I enjoy writing code (obviously).
- Music sustains me. Here are a few bullets about my musical interests:
  - Old-time folk, blues, and country. Anything pre-1950 really gets my blood pumping.
  - Cajun music. This is a recent obsession. I love the accordion and the fiddle. I've also started learning Cajun French, which was unexpected. I was never a big fan of French in school, *mais, asteur moi j'aime apprendre le fran√ßais Cadien!*
  - I play the banjo and guitar, and am teaching myself how to fiddle.
- I am married and have a son who just turned 18. We also have two cats, Peter and Gwen. Yes, they're named after the characters in Spider-Man. Peter is a big orange tabby, and Gwen is a petite tuxedo cat.
- The best TV show to ever air is Deadwood. I will fight you on this.
- I have sleep apnea and use a CPAP machine. While it's helped me get better sleep, my wife is most excited by the fact that I no longer snore.
- I like taking 20 minute walks daily. It helps clear my head, get some fresh air, and get some exercise. I have actually lost weight, though it was not the primary goal.
- I attended college for four years, then dropped out during my senior year. My major was Spanish, with a minor in anthropology. Regrets are ever-present, but I try to remind myself that I turned out fine, and have been successful in life in my career in spite of it.
- I haved lived in Texas for the past twenty-five years, but I grew up in the Northeast &mdash; New Jersey, to be exact. When I first moved here, everyone was so friendly that I thought they were just trying to get something from me. After a few years, I learned how to be "Texas polite" and for the most part, consider myself a Texan now. Every once in a while a New Jersey-ism slips out, but it's rarer with each passing year.
