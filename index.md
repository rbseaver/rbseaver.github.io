## Fun Facts

I'm a software engineer who lives in Austin, TX. Rather than trying to come up with elegant prose, I thought I'd just list some of my interests and hobbies, as well as some fun facts.

- I enjoy writing code (obviously)
- Music sustains me. Here are a few bullets about my musical interests:
  - Old-time folk, blues, and country. Anything pre-1950 really gets my blood pumping.
  - Cajun music. This is a recent obsession. I love the accordion and the fiddle. I've also started learning Cajun French, which was unexpected. I was never a big fan of French in school, *mais, asteur moi j'aime apprendre le fran√ßais Cadienne!*
  - I play the banjo and guitar, and am teaching myself how to fiddle.
- I am married and have a son who just turned 18. We also have two cats, Peter and Gwen. Yes, they're named after the characters in Spider-Man. Peter is a big orange tabby, and Gwen is a petite tuxedo cat.
- The best TV show to ever air is Deadwood. I will fight you on this.
- I have sleep apnea and use a CPAP machine. While it's helped me get better sleep, my wife is most excited by the fact that I no longer snore.
- I like taking 20 minute walks daily. It helps clear my head, get some fresh air, and get some exercise. I have actually lost weight, though it was not the primary goal.
- I attended college for four years, then dropped out during my senior year. My major was Spanish, with a minor in anthropology. Regrets are ever-present, but I try to remind myself that I turned out fine, and have been successful in life in my career in spite of it.
- I haved lived in Texas for the past twenty-five years, but I grew up in the Northeast &mdash; New Jersey, to be exact. When I first moved here, everyone was so friendly that I thought they were just trying to get something from me. After a few years, I learned how to be "Texas polite" and for the most part, consider myself a Texan now. Every once in a while a New Jersey-ism slips out, but it's rarer with each passing year.
